## Playing Clovin
- **Madness**: "Being drunk keeps me sane."
	- He is drunk most of the time, but not to the extent that it impedes his combat ability, and his musical performance improves when he is inebriated
- The larger head does all the talking
	- The smaller head has a forked snake's tongue and can't do anything except hiss and make other horrible sounds


## History/Info
- Appearance:
	- Clovin stands 4 feet, 7 inches tall and has a barrel-like shape
	- His right head is fully formed and combines the features of a patchy-haired man with those of a goat, complete with stubby horns
	- His left head is about half normal size and has a soft, cherubic face partly covered with crocodilian hide
	- Clovin has a crab's pincer in place of his left hand and a bear's paw where his right foot should be
	- He wears an ill-fitting monk's robe with a belt made of hempen rope.
- Abbot's favorite:
	- Clovin is the Abbot's faithful martinet
	- but he is despised by the other mongrelfolk, who accuse him of hoarding food and slowly starving them to death
	- He would let them starve, but the Abbot has forbidden it
