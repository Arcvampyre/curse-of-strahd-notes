## Playing Marzena

**Madness**: "I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they're watching me all the time."
- Skittish and afraid of everyone/everything except [[Clovin Belview|Clovin]]

## History/Info
- Appearance
	- Marzena stands 4 feet, 5 inches tall and has a hunched posture
	- Long, stringy black hair hides much of her face, but clearly visible are the spider mandibles and teeth that replace her human mouth
	- She has the arms and wings of a bat, as well as a cloven hoof in place of her right foot
	- She doesn't allow anyone to get close enough to undo her shackles, but if her bonds are magically unlocked or if her chains are somehow broken, she flies away and never returns.
