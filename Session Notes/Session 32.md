## Lady Kate's Wonder Emporium

The group makes their way back down the mountain to the village. They go looking for places to shop, and find a little thrift store set up in the living room of someone's cottage.

They meet [[Kate]] and trade her for a couple interesting items:
- [[Shalooti]] trades a ring that never tarnishes for yet another deck of cards; these are Tarokka cards just like the ones [[Madam Eva]] used to tell the group's fortune
- [[Bardolf]] trades his packet of fire sauce for a jar with two blinking humanoid eyes floating in brine

The group inspected the other items for anything magical/useful, but found nothing else of note, except for a whole collection of [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] toys.

Outside, they hear a commotion and the cheering of a crowd

## Delivery!

They come out of the thrift store to find that [[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]] and [[Dag Tomescu|Dag]] from the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of Wines]] have arrived in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] with a shipment of wine. With them is a strange [[Vistani]]  woman the party hasn't met.

The townsfolk are excited to finally receive the shipment, but after talking with [[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]], we learn that they don't seem to have the money to pay for their wine casks. [[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]] asks the party if they would help distribute the wine to some addresses in town. Each person takes a cask and head out.

[[Elora]] and [[Anakir]] are able to get full price for their wine, [[Shalooti]], [[Bardolf]], and [[Pelanil]] get less than what they'd hoped. [[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]] told the party to keep their earnings since they own part of the winery now.

## Shalooti's new Bear

As [[Shalooti]] heads back from delivering her wine, she notices that her polar bear is rushing towards her. No longer under her command, it seems to be out for blood. It swipes at her face, slashing into her skin. She's able to quickly tame it and bring it back under her control for another 24 hours.

## Trip to the Winery

With all the wine delivered, the group decides to accompany [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] back to the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of Wines]] in their wagon. On the trip, they get to know the [[Vistani]] woman.

### Ezmerelda

Her name is [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]], and she tells the group the following about herself:

- She is not Barovian
- She came to this land in search of her mentor, [[Rictavio|Dr. Rudoph van Richten]]
- She thought she would find him at [[The Tower]] on the lake as it seemed to the type of place he would hide away
	- She found much of his stuff there, but did not find him
- She went in search of him in a burning [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]], but was harassed by [[Fiona Wachter|Burgomistress Wachter]]'s guards because of her [[Vistani]] heritage
- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] gave her refuge at their inn
- She decided to help escort [[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]] and [[Dag Tomescu|Dag]] to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] and back to [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]]

The group all gasped at the mention of [[Rictavio|van Richten]]. Recognizing the group's surprise at the name asked if they knew of him. The party explained that [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] was after him, and [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] explained that killing [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] was the whole reason [[Rictavio|van Richten]] came to Barovia in the first place. He's a renowned monster hunter, and now in his eighties, was ready to take on the vampire himself.

She described [[Rictavio|van Richten]] to the party as an old-but-fit, flamboyant man who loves to put on disguises. The party thought this sounded an awful lot like [[Rictavio]] who the met in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]].

### Vallaki

[[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]] also chimed in to tell the group what she new of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]:
- At the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]], [[Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] struggled to light the wicker sun
- A guard let out a poorly timed laugh
- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] had him tied to a donkey (she thinks she remembers someone saying the donkey's name was [[Carlos]]) and dragged around the square
- At this, especially after the vampire attack just the day before, the townsfolk revolted
- They hanged [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] and his wife [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] in the streets
	- Their son [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] was nowhere to be found
- [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] took advantage of chaos as an opportunity to seize power
- Half the town is dead, half the buildings burned, and everyone is too scared to come out of their houses

## Blinsky Returns

At the winery, [[Pelanil]] runs from the wagon straight to the cellar (the rest of the crew think nothing of this since [[Pelanil]] has been known to do this sort of thing). Good again and feeling remorseful for his actions, he visits [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]]'s body in the refrigeration cave.

He burns some of his high-level spell slots to bring [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] back to live. The corpse sits upright, lets out an inhuman scream, and jerks its head towards [[Pelanil]].

Successfully, reanimated, [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] runs starts backing away from [[Pelanil]] deeper into the cave. [[Pelanil]] puts a hand on him to stop him and whispers "I'm sorry". [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] wraps him in a hug and tells him it's ok.

[[Bardolf]] is surprised to see [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] alive since he thought he killed him when he was a werewolf. [[Bardolf]] starts to question if his memories are even real. Ever since taking the belladonna root, dying, and being revived, he hasn't quite felt like himself. [[Pelanil]] explains what happened, but [[Bardolf]] won't hear it.

[[Piccolo]] chooses [[Pelanil]] over [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]].

## Surprise Birthday Party

[[Shalooti]] poops the gem out of her butt into a hole in the vineyard and the vines in that section already start looking more healthy.

The group is surprised to see [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] alive. [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] is surprised that multiple days have passed, and says he needs to get back to his toyshop in [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]. The group explains that his shop is burned down, but that there is a lady ([[Kate]]) in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] that has a whole collection. They tell him that she loves him, and [[Pelanil]] offers to perform a marriage ceremony.

[[Elora]] says that being brought back to life is like having a new birthday. The group decides to celebrate.

[[Pelanil]] conjures a huge cake, and the wine flows freely. [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] swims in the vats.

## Plans for Tomorrow

Before turning in for the night, the party talks with [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and decide to travel with her to [[The Tower]] on the lake in search of [[Rictavio|van Richten]]. She tells them she's nervous to see her mentor again and explains her history with [[Rictavio|van Richten]]:

- As a girl, her family was less than honest
- Her parents kidnapped [[Rictavio|van Richten]]'s son and sold him to a vampire
- [[Rictavio|van Richten]] came looking for him, but spared her family's lives
- Years later, when she was 15, she left her family and searched out [[Rictavio|van Richten]]
- She trained under [[Rictavio|van Richten]] for a few years
- They bickered all the time and eventually it became too much, and they decided to go separate ways to keep the small shred of friendship in tact
