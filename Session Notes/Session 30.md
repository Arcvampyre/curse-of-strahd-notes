## Krezk Gate

As the group tended to their fireball wounds, the carriage made its way the rest of the way to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]. As they headed north, the chill in the air finally gave way to snow. The party exited the carriage and walked up to inspect a closed gate.

As [[Pelanil]] checked the gate, a voice piped up from within one of the gate towers. The guard introduced herself as [[Joanna]] and asked what the party's business was in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]. She immediately recognized [[Shalooti]] and claimed to have heard all of her music. She told the group she didn't have the authority to let them in, but that she would fetch [[Dmitri Krezkov|Burgomaster Krezkov]].

After a few minutes, [[Joanna]] and [[Dmitri Krezkov]] walked through the gate, and the Burgomaster welcomed the party to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]. While he didn't recognize [[Shalooti]], [[Joanna]]'s recommendation was glowing, so he decided to escort the party to his "mansion" to perform.

## The Burgomaster's Mansion

Inside the gates, the party realizes that [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] is but a small village nestled within a forest and apparently pretty poor. They soon also learn the the Burgomaster's mansion is simply a cottage slightly larger than the others. [[Pelanil]] splits off to go directly towards [[The Abbey]] on the hill.

[[Dmitri Krezkov|Burgomaster Krezkov]] explains to the party that it would be only him, his wife [[Anna Krezkova|Anna]], and his son [[Ilya Krezkov|Ilya]] attending the show. The rest of the townsfolk were out preparing for the onset of winter. [[Shalooti]], [[Bardolf]], and [[Anakir]] ask what they can do to help, offering to fetch some wine that has not arrived in some time.

The Burgomaster and his wife share the following information:
- Their son [[Ilya Krezkov|Ilya]] was recently brought back to life by [[The Abbot]]
	- They had 4 children, all of which died from disease/famine
	- [[Ilya Krezkov|Ilya]] was their last
	- They stopped [[The Abbot]] at the [[Village of Krezk (S)#S4. Pool and Shrine|Shrine of the White Sun]] and begged for his help
- History of [[The Abbey]]:
	- The [[Village of Krezk (S)#S10. Abbey Entrance|Abbey of Saint Markovia]] is named after a priest of the [[The Morninglord|Morninglord]] who took a stand against the devil [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. After a fierce uprising, [[Markovia]] and her most loyal followers stormed [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]], only to be destroyed
	- The abbey was once a hospital and a convent, but it fell on hard times after the land was swallowed up by the mists. Some of the clergy fell prey to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], while others went mad and either starved themselves to death or turned to cannibalism.
	- The head of the abbey, called simply [[The Abbot]], arrived over a century ago and hasn't aged a day since. He occasionally visits the [[Village of Krezk (S)#S4. Pool and Shrine|Shrine of the White Sun]] but doesn't talk much, and he demands tribute in the form of wine. No one knows his true name or where he came from, and many believe he's [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s servant or the vampire himself in disguise.
	- No one from the village visits the abbey anymore. The abbey's bell rings at odd times, day and night, and the place is filled with baleful screams and horrible, inhuman laughter that can be heard throughout the village.
- The town has recently had a problem with livestock disappearing, and they are worried that they may not make it through the winter without that food
	- They point the party towards the livestock keeper [[Luca]]

After agreeing to a bigger show after the food problem has been taken care of, they ask [[Shalooti]] and her "band" to provide just a quick show.

The party performs. [[Bardolf]] plays by smashing rocks together, and [[Escher]] steals the show by twerking.

After their personal show, the Krezkovs recommend that the party go tend to [[Pelanil]] as he may be in danger going to the Abbey alone.

## The Abbey

[[Pelanil]] makes his way up the steep hill the gates of the Abbey. As he arrives, the bell tolls and he hears the most ungodly and nearly inhuman set of screams, howls, barking, and braying. At the gate, he shouts and he demands to see [[The Abbot]].

At this, two creatures that were sleeping at their posts at the gate, jump up to greet [[Pelanil]]. One of them brays loudly and says something incomprehensible in broken common, and the other hides its face.

[[Pelanil]] places his hand on the one that resembles a donkey, [[Otto Belview|Otto]], and calms him with a spell. [[Otto Belview|Otto]] leads [[Pelanil]] wordlessly towards the main entrance of the Abbey as the rest of the party make it to the top of the hill.
