## Pelanil at the Abbey

[[Otto Belview|Otto]] and [[Zygfrek Belview|Zygfrek]] led [[Pelanil]] to the gates of the Abbey. Atop the battlements, [[Pelanil]] saw two scarecrows placed to look like guards. Inside the courtyard, he heard large flapping wings. He asked [[Zygfrek Belview|Zygfrek]] how to get in, and she simply pushed on the large wooden door for him.

Inside the courtyard, he saw a mongrelfolk chained to a tethering post ([[Marzena Belview|Marzena]]). She was flapping her wings, stretching her chain, and muttering nonsense about someone being after her. [[Pelanil]] [[Command]]ed her to stop, and she settled to the ground, continuing to mutter quietly to herself.

## The Party Catches Up

At this point, the rest of the party, winded after their 700 ascent, made it through the entrance gates. They met [[Otto Belview|Otto]] and [[Zygfrek Belview|Zygfrek]]. [[Elora]] introduced herself to [[Otto Belview|Otto]], and asked if he'd seen her friend. He said of course he knew (***hee-haw, hee-haw***) because of how smart, fast, beautiful, and strong he was. [[Zygfrek Belview|Zygfrek]], hiding her face, simply pointed towards the courtyard gates.

Unclear which way to go to find [[The Abbot]], [[Elora]] decides to explore the courtyard. Just as she looks over the edge of the well, the bell rings again, and the party hears a cacophony of voices, barks, brays, and other animal sounds come from the residential wing of the abbey. Mixed with the noise, they are able to make out the words, "food, food, give me food".

Inside the well, [[Elora]] can make out a figure clinging to the side. It starts to make its way towards her at a sprint. As the party prepares for battle, [[Pelanil]] again commands the creature with a [[Thaumaturgy]]-enhanced booming voice, "Enough!". [[Mishka Belview|Mishka]] stops at the edge of the well, his head just over the top.

Again, [[Pelanil]] asks where to find [[The Abbot]], and [[Mishka Belview|Mishka]] tells him he's usually inside the main hall and points to the door to the west.

## The Abbot and the Bride

Inside the main hall, the party notices gentle music coming from upstairs, a young woman with alabaster skin, and a handsome young man in a brown monk's robe.

[[Pelanil]] immediately approaches [[The Abbot]], explains his predicament, and asks for the help [[Jesus]] told him he'd find here. [[The Abbot]] agrees, but asks for a small payment in return. "I notice that you have the most well-rounded bellybutton I have ever seen."

[[Pelanil]] immediately pulls out a knife, chops off his bellybutton, and heals over the wound. [[The Abbot]] explains that he has facilities in which to perform the procedure, but thanks [[Pelanil]] nonetheless.

## Pelanil is Healed

[[The Abbot]] lays his hand on [[Pelanil]]'s head, and an explosion of light emanates from the Abbey. All of [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] feels the presence of the light and benefits from its healing power. [[Pelanil]]'s features change back to be more like he was before he died. His enormous size decreased, his hair changed back, and his eyes returned to normal.

During his transformation, [[Pelanil]] feels [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]]'s anger as their connection is severed, and [[Pelanil]] once again feels the presence of his deity, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ of Nazareth]].

## Questioning the Abbot

[[Anakir]] notices something odd about [[Vasilka]]: Her skin has seams, and she seems to be built from disparate body parts. Most notably, [[Anakir]] recognizes her hair looks just like [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s did before she died. It is dyed black with auburn roots showing near her scalp.

[[Elora]] is leery of [[The Abbot]] and has more questions for him. She asks about [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], about the mongrelfolk, and about his relationship to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]].

We learn the following:
- On [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]:
	- He knows about [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s love for [[Tatyana]] and that they were separated by death
	- He believes that [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] mistreats his subjects because of his loss
	- He thinks that he can curtail [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s ire by presenting him [[Vasilka]] as a bride
	- "I want to rid Barovia of its sickness. By giving the devil his heart's desire, I bring salvation to him and his land."
- On [[Vasilka]]:
	- He's creating her as a bride for [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- He plans to lure [[Tatyana]]'s soul, memories and all, into the vessel
	- He needs more information on the magic needed to complete the ritual
		- He believes the information can be found at [[The Amber Temple (X)|The Amber Temple]]
		- He shows the party it's exact location on a map and warns them the [[Tsolenka Pass (T)|Tsolenka Pass]] is treacherous. 
- On [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]:
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] brought her here recently to revive her
		- For the first time ever, he was unsuccessful
	- He wishes he'd had her alive as it may have simplified the [[Tatyana]] ritual
	- He and [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] buried her
	- He had [[Otto Belview|Otto]] dig up her body so that he could scalp her and add her hair to [[Vasilka]]
- On the mongrelfolk:
	- They were a sick family that asked him to heal them
	- He did, but they also asked to be made more perfect
	- He gave them the strange features they requested

[[Elora]] is disgusted by his answers, and says that the mongrelfolk, "may have been better left alone" as she turns to leave.

	- The abbot said he would look for one

- Shalooti drew a card
